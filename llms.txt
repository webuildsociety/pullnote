# Pullnote

> Pullnote is a cloud-based headless API that provides a simple database to store and retrieve content using NPM, REST, or MCP Server integration. It eliminates the need to build a content backend for each project by offering a centralized content management system with an optional human editor interface at pullnote.com.

Pullnote is designed for developers who need a lightweight, API-first content management solution. It supports both programmatic content creation and human editing through a web interface. The service includes AI-powered content generation capabilities and provides multiple integration methods including a JavaScript client library, REST API, and MCP server for LLM tools.

Key features include hierarchical content organization using paths, AI-powered content generation, image generation, SEO-friendly metadata, and flexible data storage. The API supports both manual content creation and AI-assisted generation using prompts.
